"""
Streamlit application for the Product visibility project.

This app provides two user roles: consumers and outlet owners.  Consumers
can sign up with a favourite drink and their location, log in, and see
nearby outlets along with predicted stock conditions and alternative
recommendations.  Outlet owners can register their business, specify
what brands they stock, and view basic analytics.  The app also lays
the groundwork for future features such as ordering and real‑time
hawker alerts.

Note: This implementation emphasises readability and demonstrates
basic interactions with the database and machine‑learning models.  It
does not cover every nuance of the planned recommendation logic.  You
can extend these foundations by logging user interactions and
progressively training more personalised models.
